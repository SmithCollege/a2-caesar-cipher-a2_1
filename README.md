## Reflection Questions

What was your favorite part of this assignment?

Rimi: My favorite part of this assignment was decoding and encoding strings. It was fun to implement the Caesar Cipher and see what a sentence could become when encoded. It was also fun to figure out what an encoded message would actually say and then check it with our decoder.

Sam: The best part of this assignment was creating dynamic array because we had already prototyped it. All we had to do was implement it without using pseudocode and that was easy to do and a good recap of syntax and concepts we learned in csc120.

What was most challenging about this assignment?

Rimi: The most challenging part of this assignment was creating the encoders and decoders. We didn't realize stringbuilder existed at first but once we discovered it, it became easier. But it was slightly challenging to incorporate the logic of encoder and decoder.

Sam: Writing the tests for encode and decode was the most challenging part because it required you to think of edge cases. Also, I have never written tests for a cs class before so figuring that out was pretty challenging.

General comments on your experience with this assignment:

Rimi: This assignment was extremely difficult and daunting at first and we didn't even turn it in fully finished until the resubmission. But doing this assignment now after everything we have learned made it much easier and less intimidating.

Sam: This assignment didn't go very smoothly at first but we managed to finish and pass all our tests. It's very fun to see that the tests are passing one by one and also gratifying. It was also just a bad week both mentally and academically. A lot of work piled up for our group and we were very overwhelmed.
